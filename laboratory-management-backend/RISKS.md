# Project Risk Assessment

This document outlines potential risks for the Laboratory Management System project and how we plan to mitigate them.

## 1. Technical Complexity Risks

* **Risk:** The project uses technologies that are new to me, like Docker, AWS, and advanced CI/CD pipelines. [cite_start]The learning curve might be steep. [cite: 326]
* [cite_start]**Mitigation:** The project plan already includes dedicated "Learning Days"[cite: 19, 28, 90]. I will use this time effectively and not hesitate to look up documentation and tutorials.

## 2. Timeline Risks

* **Risk:** Some tasks might take longer than the single day allotted in the plan.
* **Mitigation:** I will focus on the main goal for each day. [cite_start]If a task spills over, I will note it and use the "Buffer Day" [cite: 41] mentioned in the plan to catch up. I will prioritize progress over perfection in the initial stages.

## 3. Security Risks

* [cite_start]**Risk:** As a beginner, I might not be aware of all security best practices for handling user data and payments. [cite: 335]
* [cite_start]**Mitigation:** The plan specifically includes security reviews and best practices (like password hashing) at each relevant step[cite: 32, 52, 63]. I will pay close attention to these tasks.
